Intro to C++ labs and assignments.


lab 10 - Header file that contains "studentType" class with private and public members.
"StudentType.cpp" CPP file that contains a default constructor and a parameterized constructor to initialize student objects with setter functions to assign values to the private data members and getter functions to retrieve the values of the data members. "StudentTypeTest.cpp" CPP file is the driver program containing main to test the "StudentType" class.
Lab 9- Program that automates a breakfast billing system. The program displays the menu and allows the user to select options. After finishing the selection, it calculates the bill including sales tax. It also involves reading in files (menu.txt).
Lab 8- A 25x25 2D array battleship game simulation. The game reads an initial game board setup from a file (gameBoard.txt), where: '~' represents water (no ship), '#' represents a ship part, 'H' represents a ship part that has been hit, and 'M' represents a missed shot. The program allows the user to input the X and Y coordinates and includes functions to check if ships have been hit or sunk. It also includes a while loop that continues until the game finishes and functions that show the user the board and updates it after every turn.
Lab 7- Program that calculates a person's weight on different celestial bodies in the solar system. It prompts the user to input their weight and their desired celestial body. The program uses an enum to represent different celestial bodies and a function that calculates the user weight on the selected celestial body. The program also involves error checking and input validation. Uses switch case.
Lab 6- This program calculates the annual cost of a fitness center membership based on user-selected discounts, such as senior citizen rates, prepaid annual membership, and personal training session discounts. It utilizes a menu-driven interface, functions for modular design, and important programming concepts like pass-by-reference parameters to update user choices, switch statements for handling menu options, and arithmetic operations to compute discounts and final costs. The program ensures dynamic user interaction and accurate billing by combining various discounts and membership options.
Lab 5- This program calculates the optimal number of apartment units to rent to maximize profit for a real estate office. It reads initial values, such as the total number of units, base rent, and maintenance costs from an input file, and prompts the user for the rent increase increment. Using a loop, the program iteratively adjusts rent and the number of units to calculate profit, stopping when further increases no longer yield higher profits. Key programming concepts include file handling, input validation, arithmetic operations for profit calculation, and a while loop for iterative optimization.
Lab 4- This program calculates the total cost of booking hotel rooms based on user input and discounts for bulk bookings and extended stays. It reads the base room rate and tax rate from an input file (input.dat) and prompts the user for the number of rooms and days they wish to book. The program calculates discounts (up to 30% for large bookings and an additional 5% for stays of three or more days), computes the total cost including sales tax, and writes the results to an output file (output.dat). Key programming concepts include file input/output, conditional statements (if and else if) for discount calculations, and formatted output using ofstream and manipulators like setw and setprecision for neat presentation.
Lab 3- This program calculates the interest on a credit card's unpaid balance using the average daily balance method. It reads input values—such as net balance, payment amount, billing cycle days (d1), days payment was made before the cycle ended (d2), and the interest rate per month—from an input file (input.dat). The program computes the average daily balance and calculates the monthly interest based on a specified interest rate, outputting the result formatted to two decimal places. Key programming concepts used include file handling (ifstream), arithmetic operations for financial calculations, and formatted output with manipulators like setprecision.
Lab 2 - Simple program that prompts user input of tank capacity, in gallons, of an automobile and mpg the automobile can be driven. Outputs the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
